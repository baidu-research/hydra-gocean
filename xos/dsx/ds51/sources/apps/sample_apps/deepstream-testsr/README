Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation and installation steps:
  $ cd sample_apps/deepstream-testsr/
  $ make

To run(Currently single source is supported):
  $ ./deepstream-testsr-app <rtsp uri with H264 video stream>
e.g.
By default, recording with bbox is enabled
  $ ./deepstream-testsr-app rtsp://127.0.0.1/video1
To disable the bbox in the recorded video use "-e 0" at the end of command
  $ ./deepstream-testsr-app rtsp://127.0.0.1/video1 -e 0

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-testsr application.

It is meant for simple demonstration of how to use the various DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and record a video stream.

This sample app demonstrates the usage of smart record APIs to record
portions of the input video. The recorded file will have bboxes in it.
User can disable bboxes in recorded files by following the steps mentioned above.
User can update smart-record parameters i.e. SMART_REC_CONTAINER,
VIDEO_CACHE_SIZE, SMART_REC_DEFAULT_DURATION, START_TIME.
Follow the compilation process mentioned above and re-run the app.
