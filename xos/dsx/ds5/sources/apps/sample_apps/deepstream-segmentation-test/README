Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Pipeline:
filesrc -> jpegparse -> nvv4l2decoder -> nvstreammux -> nvinfer/nvinferserver (segmentation)
nvsegvidsual -> nvmultistreamtiler -> (nvegltransform) -> nveglglessink

Compilation Steps:
  $ cd apps/deepstream-segmentation-test/
  $ make
  $ ./deepstream-segmentation-app [-t infer-type] config_file <file1> [file2] ... [fileN]
    # -t infer-type: select from [infer, inferserver], infer by default


E.g. for semantic segmentation, it needs semantic model which can get 4 classes map,
including backgroud, car, person, bicycle.
"nvsegvidsual" plugin chooses 4 different colors for them and to display.
  $ ./deepstream-segmentation-app dstest_segmentation_config_semantic.txt sample_720p.mjpeg sample_720p.mjpeg

E.g. for industrial segmentation, it needs industrial model which can only get defective
area map.
  $ ./deepstream-segmentation-app dstest_segmentation_config_industrial.txt sample_industrial.jpg

Don't forget to change batch-size to match the number of input files.
